# Enhancements

- CloudFormationStackEvent objects are now serializable.
- ResponseURL is now an optional argument to custom resource requests, to allow for easier testing.  
- The lambda output for Custom Resources is now the full response that would've been sent to CloudFormation, rather than just the output data.

# Bug Fixes

- Fixes an issue where SnsMessage objects would fail to deserialize.
