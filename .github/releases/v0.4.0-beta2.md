This release introduces the following:

- Updates decryption to use initialization services for the following benefits:
  - Avoid possibility of deadlocks by not using Task.WaitAll in the post configure hook.
  - Run decryption on multiple IOptions in parallel
  - Run decryption in parallel with other initialization services.
- Fixes an issue where initialization services were getting called on every call to the Lambda.
- Now checking for correct formatting across the solution after every build, including in CICD.  This means PR checks will fail if your changes to not comply with our preferred code style.
