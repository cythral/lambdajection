This release introduces the following:

- Lambda.Encryption package
  - Use the [Encrypted] attribute on option properties that should be decrypted on startup
  - By default, encrypted properties will be decrypted using KMS.
  - Use your own decryption service by injecting an IDecryptionService singleton into the IoC container at startup.
- NuGet Package Version Badges in the README! Easily check the latest version of each package right from the Lambdajection repository.
