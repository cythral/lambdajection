# Enhancements:

- Added cancellationToken parameter to IAwsFactory.
- No longer packaging AWSSDK.Core in the Lambdajection.Generator package - this is restored and resolved from the RestorePackagesPath at build time, along with other generator-specific dependencies.
- Minimum AWSSDK is now 3.7
- There is no longer a generator-specific restore, generator dependencies are all restored in the solution-level restore target.
- The generator attempts to load all matching assemblies one at a time, until one loads successfully. Before, it would only attempt to load one.
- Lambdajection.Attributes is no longer a reference assembly.  To avoid adding it to the runtime assemblies, we are instead setting PrivateAssets="runtime" wherever it is referenced.  With that, Lambdajection.Generator is no longer packaging the attributes assembly.

# New Features:

- Adds an IAM Access Analyzer, which will collect the minimum IAM permissions needed for running your lambda or custom resource and output them to a file.
- Adds CloudFormation template generation!  No extra configuration needed, templates will be generated and output to $(OutDir)/{ClassName}.template.yml
  - At the moment, template generation for lambdas using Lambdajection.Runtime and/or Lambdajection.Layer are not supported (this will be added in v0.9.0).
  - Templates are generated on a per-lambda basis. An option to combine all lambdas into one template will be provided in future versions.
