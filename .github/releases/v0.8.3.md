## Bug Fixes

- Fixes an issue where templates generated for Lambdas that don't interact with an AWS API would have a role policy with 0 actions, which is not allowed in CloudFormation.
- Fixes an issue where generation would fail if the project did not have a direct reference to the AWSSDK.
- Fixes an issue where validations were being applied to old resource properties, which would cause resource creation failures if using the validation attributes.
