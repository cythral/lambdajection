This release introduces the following:

- Add options to your Lambda's IoC container using the new LambdaOptions attribute - no more need for explicitly registering IOptions instances in startup.
- Add AWS Services to your Lambda's IoC container using the IServiceCollection.UseAwsService extension.
- Adding an AWS Service will also automatically add an IAwsFactory to the IoC container for that service. Use it to create clients with an assumed role.
  - Factories are only generated if AWSSDK.SecurityToken is a dependency of your project.
  - If you do not add AWSSDK.SecurityToken as a dependency, there will be a build-time warning explaining this. Silence this by adding LJ0002 to your NoWarn msbuild property.
