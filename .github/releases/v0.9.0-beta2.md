- Enables .NET 6 support
  - Lambdajection.Layer no longer contains pre-optimized packages due to a bug in the .NET 6 SDK.
  - Lambdas that include Lambdajection.Runtime will now have to set RuntimeIdentifier and SelfContained properties to true in their csproj due to backwards-incompatible changes in the .NET SDK starting in version 6.0.100.
