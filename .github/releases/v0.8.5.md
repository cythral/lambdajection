- Enables .NET 6 support
  - Lambdajection.Layer dual-targets .NET 5 and .NET 6.  This unfortunately results in a larger layer size.  Future versions will include .NET 6 only.
  - Lambdas that include Lambdajection.Runtime will now have to set RuntimeIdentifier and SelfContained properties to true in their csproj due to backwards-incompatible changes in the .NET SDK starting in version 6.0.100.
