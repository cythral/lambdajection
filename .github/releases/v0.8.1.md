## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where StyleCop and other analyzers were analyzing generated code and causing a bunch of warnings/errors depending on how you have them configured.
- Fixed an issue where projects that had a transitive reference to Lambdajection would produce a warning about how the generator would not contribute any sources, along with not being able to find the "Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting" assembly.
