This release introduces the following:

- .NET Templates are here!  Install via `dotnet new -i Lambdajection.Templates`.  Templates are available for both projects and options.
- IDisposable and IAsyncDisposable Lambdas are now fully supported.  Disposers will be called at the end of each invocation. If you implement both IDisposable and IAsyncDisposable, DisposeAsync will be preferred.
- Added an example for custom config factories.
- Upgrades Roslyn to 3.7.0 (via CodeGeneration.Roslyn) for latest bug and security fixes, along with increased nullability checks.  Addressed changes around new possible null references.
