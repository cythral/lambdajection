New in v0.6.0:

- Upgraded Cythral.CloudFormation.BuildTasks to v0.4.2 for increased end-to-end test stability (these sometimes failed before due to base64 keys containing characters that are not safe for URLs).
- Upgraded AWSSDK.Core to 3.5.1.57
- Upgraded AWSSDK.KeyManagementService to 3.5.1
- Upgraded Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection to 5.0.1
- Upgraded Amazon.Lambda.RuntimeSupport to 1.3.0

Also includes everything from the first 4 betas:

- Removed the ILambdaContext parameter.  This is now accessible via constructor dependency injection instead.
- Adds a CancellationToken parameter to coordinate cancellation of child tasks.  Forward this to any awaited calls in your Handle function.
- The "Run" method name can now be customized.
- A Lambda Layer containing Lambdajection and all its dependencies is now available!  See the README for usage.
