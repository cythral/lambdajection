This includes a hotfix for v0.8.0-beta2: An earlier version of the AWS SDK was being restored, which did not bring in Microsoft.Bcl.AsyncInterfaces 5.0.0. The restore and assembly load process for the generator has also been simplified further:  

- There is no longer a generator-specific restore, generator dependencies are all restored in the solution-level restore target.
- The generator attempts to load all matching assemblies one at a time, until one loads successfully. Before, it would only attempt to load one.
- Lambdajection.Attributes is no longer a reference assembly.  To avoid adding it to the runtime assemblies, we are instead setting PrivateAssets="runtime" wherever it is referenced.  With that, Lambdajection.Generator is no longer packaging the attributes assembly.
