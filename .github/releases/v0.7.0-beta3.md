Bug Fixes:

- Fixed an issue where the generator would attempt to generate validations for collection types, which would result in a stack overflow.  The validations generator no longer recurses into these types, or any type that lives in an assembly that starts with "System"
- Fixed an issue where validations were being generated for private and protected properties.
