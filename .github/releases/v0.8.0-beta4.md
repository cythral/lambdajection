- Adds an IAM Access Analyzer, which will collect the minimum IAM permissions needed for running your lambda or custom resource and output them to a file.  By default, this file is located at $(IntermediateOutputPath)IamPermissions.txt, but can be customized via the $(LambdajectionIamPermissionsOutputPath) property.
- Fixed an issue where compilation would sometimes fail for custom resources with an error like 'Could not load file Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting'.
