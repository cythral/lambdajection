## New Features:

- Create Lambda-backed Custom Resource Providers using Lambdajection! See the README and example for info.
- Add validation attributes to your request properties, and they will be automatically evaluated.  To accomplish this, Lambdajection will generate a method called 'Validate' and add it to your Handler class.

## Enhancements:

- The Generator no longer packages its own version of Lambdajection.Core, instead it will load the one used in the project from your restore directory. **You may need to run a clean after upgrading due to this.**
- Various 3rd party dependency upgrades, including Roslyn to v3.9.0.
- Now building with .NET SDK 5.0.200.
