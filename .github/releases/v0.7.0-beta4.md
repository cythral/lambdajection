New Features:

- For Custom Resources, use the UpdateRequiresReplacementAttribute to denote resource properties that, when updated, should create a new resource rather than updating the existing one.  CloudFormation will automatically call delete on the old resource when this happens.

New Packages:

- Lambdajection.Framework - we moved the framework-specific attributes here (LambdaHostAttribute, LambdaInterfaceAttribute).  This will be specifically for attributes that tell the Generator what and how to generate a Lambda.
- Lambdajection.Framework.BuildTime - used by build-time only packages that extend the functionality of the Lambda Generator, such as Lambdajection.CustomResource.BuildTime
- Lambdajection.CustomResource.BuildTime - contains a generator for the RequiresReplacement method on the ICustomResourceProvider interface.

Enhancements:

- Lambdajection.Generator no longer includes its own copy of Lambdajection.Core in its NuGet package - we've done some work to dynamically load assemblies in the Generator from outside its package.  More improvements in this area coming soon.
