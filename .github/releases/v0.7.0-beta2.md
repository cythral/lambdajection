Bug Fixes:

- Fixes an issue where error messages were being suppressed by a different message ('Invalid PhysicalResourceId') after responding to CloudFormation.

New Features:

- **Breaking Change**: Data Annotations on all request properties are now validated at runtime for each invocation.  A **Validate** method is automatically generated on your Lambda at compile-time to help accomplish this.

Updates for Contributors:
 
- Dependency updates are now automated via Nukeeper
- AWSSDK.Core is no longer a direct dependency of Lambdajection.Generator, but it will still get added to the nuget package so it can be loaded during generation if needed.
- Now Building with .NET 5.0.103

Runtime Dependency updates:

- AWSSDK.KeyManagementService to 3.5.2.12
- AWSSDK.Core to 3.5.3.1
- Amazon.Lambda.ApplicationLoadBalancerEvents to 2.1.0
