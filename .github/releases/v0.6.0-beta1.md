This release introduces the following:

- New Project Template Option: disposable - set this to true if you want the generated Lambda to implement IAsyncDisposable and IDisposable.
- Several examples have been updated to illustrate the use of the IAsyncDisposable / IDisposable pattern with Lambdajection.
- As a housekeeping item, CloudFormation stacks for examples are now deleted after end to end tests have finished running.
- The generator has been refactored with better modularity.
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: The context parameter (ILambdaContext) has been removed from ILambda.Handle.  This can now (optionally) be accessed via a constructor argument instead.  This was done to simplify the composition process and reduce the number of arguments that Handle will have - we plan on introducing cancellation tokens in the future here instead.
- Updated Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.* Dependencies from 3.8.0-5.final to 3.8.0
- Updated AWSSDK.Core from 3.5.1.34 to 3.5.1.42
- Updated AWSSDK.KeyManagementService from 3.5.0.36 to 3.5.0.42
