This release introduces the following:

- You can now control the serializer used on the Lambda by setting the Serializer argument in the Lambda attribute.  If your Lambda targets netcoreapp3.1, then DefaultLambdaJsonSerializer from Amazon.Lambda.Serialization.SystemTextJson is used by default.
- The startup argument in the Lambda attribute is now a constructor argument, rather than a named one.  This was done to enforce setting the argument earlier in the pipeline, rather than just failing during code generation.
- File-based configuration is now turned off by default in favor of environment variables-based configuration.  If you need to add file-based configuration back, you can specify a custom ILambdaConfigFactory type to the Lambda attribute's new ConfigFactory argument.
- Initialize data asynchronously or perform a startup task before the Lambda runs using initialization services!  Implement ILambdaInitializationService and add it to the container as a singleton.
