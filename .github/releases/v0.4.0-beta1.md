This release introduces the following:

- You can now control the serializer used on the Lambda by setting the Serializer argument in the Lambda attribute.  If your Lambda targets netcoreapp3.1, then DefaultLambdaJsonSerializer from Amazon.Lambda.Serialization.SystemTextJson is used by default.
- The startup argument in the Lambda attribute is now a constructor argument, rather than a named one.  This was done to enforce setting the argument earlier in the pipeline, rather than just failing during code generation.
