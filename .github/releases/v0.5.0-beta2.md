This release introduces the following:

- Fixes an issue where several template symbols were being replaced where they should not be (ie Options being replaced in the LambdaOptions attribute if you specified a custom options class name).
- Fixes an issue where an IAwsFactory was not being generated and added to the service collection for IAmazonSecurityTokenService.  This was not happening for any other service.
- Initialization services that implement IAsyncDisposabe or IDisposable will now be properly disposed prior to running your Lambda's handler.
- Adds support for Custom Runtimes via the Lambdajection.Runtime package. 
- Now building with .NET 5 RC2 SDK.  TFMs of existing packages still target netcoreapp3.1, so no visible end-user changes here.
