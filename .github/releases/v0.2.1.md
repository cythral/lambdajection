This release includes the following:

- Minor refactor of the LambdaHost class, splitting out static data initialization into a new class, LambdaHostBuilder.
- Introduces the usage of FxCop Analyzers in this project, and a few changes to comply to the ruleset.
- Uses Roslyn Diagnostics to report errors rather than throwing an exception.
